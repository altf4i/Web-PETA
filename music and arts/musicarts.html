   <h4 id="artsdesc">In this type of art, we make original works with only paper and other simple materials that you can find at home. Paper weaving involves easy ways to do and is very pretty when it is done. You can make paper weaving with simply interchanging the two slips of paper. We also demonstrate making paper mache, which is a craft that uses glue to harden the paper to make crafts out of it.</h4>
